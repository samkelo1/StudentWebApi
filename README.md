# ASP.NET Core Student Web Api with Entity Framework , mysql & Swagger.
In this repository I want to give a plain starting point at how to build a WebAPI with ASP.NET Core.

This repository contains:
1. Student Controller which is dealing with students. You can GETALL/GET/POST/PUT/DELETE them, and GET courses for a spesific student.


2. Course Controller which is dealing with courses. You can GETALL/GET/POST/PUT/DELETE them,GET students for a specific course, Add Student to a course, DELETE Student from a course  .


3. Department Controller which is dealing with Departments. You can GETALL/GET/POST/PUT/DELETE them.
